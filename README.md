### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was the DMV. They wanted an online system to help customers pass their driving tests more efficiently.

### What did you do particularly well?

I believe I made the diagrams well. They explain the relations between the actor and the action that they can take when using the system.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would redo the Gantt chart. I feel as though I set unrealistic times for the steps of developing the DriverPass system. I should have spent more time on it to really learn more about the Gantt chart.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I included everything a customer needs for the system. It includes options to buy packages and set appointments while giving the employees admin type roles. It is important to consider the user's needs  while the system is being designed so as to include everything that the user needs without having to go back far into the development to revise features. It is very impractical to restart processes on a finished project versus handling it all while the product is being developed.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I like to use the Agile method for designing software. It gives me an opportunity to add features whenever I think of them without having to try to edit them in to the work later.
